Data types : 
1. diAddr - to read Discrete data, typically a boolean value that is read-only (size is 1 bit)
2. aiAddr - to read Input Register data, typically a data with unsigned value (size of 16 bits)
3. aiSAddr - to read Input Register data, typicall a data with signed value (size of 16 bits)
4. ai32Addr - to make twice the length of Input Register data request (since modbus does not support 32 bits data transaction and natively uses 16 bits per transaction), Input Register request will be made twice to accomodate the length data for 32 bits. This can be used to read both 32 bits signed and unsigned value.
5. coilAddr - to read Coil address status. Almost the same like "diAddr", but it is designed for the address that can be write. (size is 1 bit)
6. floatAddr - any data that has decimal points

Modifier for data type (diAddr/coilAddr)
1. Address - Modbus address that need to be read from
2. ifTrue - for diAddr/coilAddr, if the value is true, this is the text that will be written into the Database
3. ifFalse - for diAddr/coilAddr, if the value is flase, this is the text that will be written into the Database

Modifier for data type (aiAddr/aiSAddr/ai32Addr/float)
1. Address - Modbus address that need to be read from
min - maximum value of tag. If below this value, "ifMin" text will be recorded in Database
max - maximum value of tag. If passes this value, "ifMax" text will be recorded in Database
ifMix - text to record in Database of the tag value is below "min" value
ifMax - text to record in Database of the tag value is above "max" value
ifNormal - text to record in Database if the tag is the tag is above min and/or below max
scheduled - true/false value. If true, the tag will be set to be recorded in Database on every 1 hour
